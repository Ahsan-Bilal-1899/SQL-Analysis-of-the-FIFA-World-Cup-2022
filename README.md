# SQL-Analysis-of-the-FIFA-World-Cup-2022
In this project, I created a database on SQL Server that had 5 tables (Teams, Matches, Goals, Stadiums and Groups). Through SSMS editor, I used around 25 queries that generated relevant insights into the tournament.
The repository contains the SQL file, the entire dataset in Excel as well as an image of the Entity Relationship Diagram showing how the tables in the DB are linked.
